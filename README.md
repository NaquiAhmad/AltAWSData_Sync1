# AltAWSData_Sync1
Building a Scalable Big Data Solution on  AWS Cloud

1.	Environment Variables:

    •	Load the AWS credentials from the .env file using dotenv.

2.	boto3 Client Initialization:

    •	Initialize boto3 clients for DataSync and CloudWatch using the credentials from the environment variables.

3.	DataSync Task Setup and Execution:

    •	Functions for creating locations, tasks, starting the task execution, and monitoring the task status are provided.
  	•	CloudWatch metrics are sent to monitor the task status.

5.	PySpark Integration:

    •	After the data synchronization is complete, a PySpark session is started.
  	•	The CSV files are read from the S3 bucket using the S3 URL (s3a:// prefix).
  	•	Data transformations are performed using PySpark (e.g., filtering out rows where the "city" column is null).
  	•	The transformed data is written back to another location in the S3 bucket.

6.	Scheduling:

    •	The schedule library is used to run the sync_data function daily at 2 AM.
  	•	The script runs indefinitely to maintain the schedule.
